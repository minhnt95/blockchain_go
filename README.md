# blockchain_go
My simple implement of blockchain with Golang.

Fork from https://github.com/Jeiwan/blockchain_go
(Many thanks to Jeiwan!)

This is part 4 of my articles about my blockchain's implement tutorial below :

1. [Basic prototype](https://github.com/mytv1/blockchain_go/tree/part_1)
2. [Network](https://github.com/mytv1/blockchain_go/tree/part_2)
3. [Proof of work](https://github.com/mytv1/blockchain_go/tree/part_3)
4. [Wallet + Address](https://github.com/mytv1/blockchain_go/tree/part_4)

I'm not good at English. So please tell me if there is something make you hard to understand.

I'm also new in Golang and Blockchain. So if you spot any problem in my code, please feel free to correct it.

TODO memo :
Part 4:
- [x] Wallet creating mechanism with command line. (Like `simplebc cw`)
- [x] Wallet private key storage in config.json (No sercurity - but easy to learning)
- [ ] Command to node for address printing

Part 5:
- [ ] Create a transaction by command line. (Like `simplebc tx -from addr1 -to addr2`)
- [ ] Send that transaction to a node.
